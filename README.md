## LAB 1
The Expense Management System Prototype was proposed on 19 September 2022 to address the financial challenges caused by inflation and rising prices, particularly in goods and transportation. In response to the economic crisis and ineffective government management, this project aims to help users manage their expenses wisely and avoid overspending. The system serves as a tool for budgeting and monitoring financial transactions, ensuring users can track their spending and make informed decisions about their finances.

The main objectives of the project include providing an easy-to-use application for tracking expenses, helping users maintain accurate records of their funds, guiding them in making sound budget allocations, and offering detailed tracking of transactions on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Ultimately, the system aims to assist users in planning future expenses and promoting responsible financial management.

The project team consists of Renmar M. Lescano as the Project Manager, Blesse Rachelle E. Borromeo as the Business Analyst, JV Renz Cimafranca as the Web Developer, and Coebe Austin Lupac as the Quality Assurance Analyst.

## LAB 2
The Expense Management System Prototype builds on the objectives outlined in LAB 1 by expanding its features and scope across multiple iterations. Initially, the system will be a Windows-based web application with core functionalities such as adding/editing expenses, a calendar, and expense statistics. Future iterations will introduce a secure login system, a gamified "ipon" feature to track savings goals with a virtual puppy, and integration with local and online bank accounts to monitor transactions. The project aims to provide users with a comprehensive, easy-to-use platform for budgeting, tracking, and managing their finances responsibly.

## LAB 3
In LAB 3, the exercise focuses on a case scenario of Project ALPHA, a system development project for a large bank in the Philippines, managed by Company A, a multinational company based in the US with offshore operations in the Philippines and India. The project team consists of 1 Project Manager (PM) and 1 Business Analyst (BA) based in the Philippines, while 2 Quality Analysts (QAs) and 3 Developers (DEVs) are based in India. This setup presents a variety of risks, including communication barriers, cultural differences, financial challenges, and technical issues due to the geographical and operational distance between the teams.

## LAB 4
In **LAB 4**, the focus was on organizing and managing the project tasks through a **Product Backlog** and **Sprint Planning**. The Product Backlog was created by identifying and prioritizing various user stories with different priority values and story points, ranging from essential features like the purchase list and login system to additional features like the "IPON" virtual pet and digital banking integration. For each user story, acceptance criteria were defined, and test cases were outlined to ensure functionality. **Sprint Planning** was also conducted, setting goals and timelines for the development process. The sprints were divided into phases, with each sprint dedicated to specific tasks such as developing core functionalities, implementing security features like 2-factor authentication, and integrating advanced features like digital banking. The **Kanban Board** was used to track progress across tasks in the "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns, while also identifying blockers such as network problems or device compatibility issues. This organized approach aimed to ensure steady progress towards building a comprehensive and secure expense management system.

## LAB 5
In **LAB 5**, we focused on defining the **functional** and **non-functional** requirements for the expense management system. The **functional requirements** specify key features that the system must support, including a side navigation panel for easy browsing, the ability for users to add, modify, and delete expense entries, access to expenditure statistics, and the ability to set and track budget goals. Users must also be able to securely log in using their email and password. On the other hand, the **non-functional requirements** emphasize the systemâ€™s overall performance and security standards. These include ensuring ease of navigation and user-friendliness, encrypting personal information to safeguard user privacy, and providing email confirmations for actions like syncing bank accounts. The system must also load within three seconds under fast internet conditions and remain accessible 24/7, with downtime limited to no more than 24 hours. These requirements ensure a balance between functionality, performance, and security for a seamless user experience.

## LAB 6
In LAB 6, we created a Gantt Chart to visualize the project timeline and manage the progress of tasks throughout the development cycle. The Gantt Chart provided a clear overview of the various phases of the project, including planning, feature development, testing, and implementation, broken down into individual tasks and sub-tasks. It helped establish deadlines for each iteration and milestone, enabling the team to monitor progress and adjust as necessary. The chart also outlined dependencies between tasks, ensuring that key components such as user stories, feature development, and testing were completed in a structured and timely manner.
